Vision Statement:
Mindshift offers a unique puzzle experience where players must experiment and think creatively to solve challenges without predetermined solutions. The game encourages resourcefulness, ingenuity, and non-linear thinking in relaxed playful lab environments. There will be extras and collectibles for the players that are looking for more of a challenge but the critical path should be easily overcomable for the casual player.

Game Elements:
Players control physics objects with unique behaviors that can be combined to help the player character, Cerebella (Sarah for short), a lab mouse, will need to overcome obstacles such as pits, spike traps, moving platforms, and tall ledges. The game uses 3D graphics but features a perspective side-scrolling camera giving players a clear and intuitive view of the puzzles. Physics objects are found in the environment itself and players must creatively use them to solve puzzles in each level.
Story/Setting:
Cerebella the lab mouse and her holographic AI best friend Blue, are celebrating Sarah’s birthday together. But while her back is turned the evil Dr. Thalamus sneaks up and snatches her friend away to do all kinds of nasty experiments on him. But luckily for Sarah she has the Brain-Band. This device allows her to move objects with her mind over short distances and gives her the ability to manipulate the environment and solve puzzles. Players must help Sarah use her new powers to navigate through the sterile research lab, and the hazardous cryostasis research lab and a radioactive quarantine zone, to get to the Teleporter Pad at the end of each level.
Core Mechanics:
Touch and Drag: The player can touch the screen and drag physics objects in real time. These objects will react based on their unique properties, whether it's floating, sticking, or bouncing.
Basic Movement: Moves Sarah left and right at the touch of a button or on screen joystick
Mantling: Sarah is able to climb over small ledges if she is close enough to them
Environment interaction: Sarah will be able to activate certain levers and buttons if she is close enough to them.
Camera: Camera will follow Sarah or zoom out to show a view of the full puzzle

Physics Objects (Player-Controlled):
These are the types of objects the player can move using the Brain Band, each with distinct behaviors that can be used creatively to solve puzzles. All objects are found within the environment, and players must make do with what is provided in each level.
Metallic Blocks:
Behavior: Heavy and stable, useful as a counter weight, placing on pressure plates, and to stop momentum of other moving objects. Cannot be pushed by wind and sinks in water. Ideal for blocking hazards or filling gaps.
Bouncy Pads:
Behavior: Springy objects that launch anything that lands on them, including Sarah.
Interaction: Can be used to reach higher platforms or to launch objects into specific positions.
Balloons:
Behavior: Objects that float upwards. Can attach the balloon string to other physics objects and add  upward force that can make items lighter, fall slower or lift up lighter items off the ground. Tapping the balloon will pop the balloon and drops whatever it was attached to. It will respawn after popping.
Interaction: Good for making arial paths.
Sticky Rope:
Behavior: A flexible rope that can stick to multiple surfaces, allowing players to create new pathways or hold other objects in place.
Interaction: Can be used to tie objects together, suspend objects in midair, or pull levers remotely.
Magnetized Plates:
Behavior: Attracted to metal surfaces, pulling themselves toward metallic objects.
Interaction: Used to pull metallic objects into specific positions or create moving platforms when attached to rails.
Wooden Planks:
Behavior: Long, sturdy, and lightweight planks that can be used as bridges or floating platforms on water.
Interaction: Wooden planks can float on water, making them perfect for creating rafts or crossing water hazards. They can also be used to span gaps or cover spike traps.
Mystery Box (Unpredictable Physics Object Generator):
Behavior: A special object in certain levels that, when activated, randomly generates a physics object for the player to use. (Developers should have control over which items can be spawned for both testing purposes and for specific level needs)
Interaction: The object generated could be any of the existing physics objects (e.g., balloons, metallic blocks, sticky rope), adding an element of unpredictability. Players must adapt to whatever object appears and use it creatively in the puzzle.

Environmental Objects & Hazards (Non-Player Controlled):
These elements are part of the environment and cannot be moved or controlled by the player, but they must be navigated or manipulated indirectly:
Spike Traps:
Behavior: Static traps that instantly defeat Sarah if touched. Will pop balloons if they come in contact with them.
Interaction: Use physics objects like metallic blocks or wooden planks to cover the spikes or create safe passages.
Pits:
Behavior: Deep gaps that Sarah cannot cross on her own.
Interaction: Place objects like wooden planks or use balloons to carry Sarah across.
Water Pools:
Behavior: Water that will cause Sarah to drown if she falls into it.
Interaction: Use floating wooden planks or balloons to create paths across the water.
Wind Gusts:
Behavior: Strong gusts that push lighter objects and Sarah
Interaction: Place or remove heavier objects to block or unleash the wind.
Electric Fields:
Behavior: Electrified zones that will harm Sarah if touched.
Interaction: Block using non-conductive objects like wooden planks or divert the electricity using conductive objects like metal blocks to clear a path out of danger.
Ice Surfaces:
Behavior: Slippery surfaces that make movement difficult, causing Sarah and lighter objects to slide uncontrollably.
Interaction: Use sticky rope or heavier objects to stop sliding and navigate these areas carefully.
Glass Surfaces:
Behavior: Fragile surfaces that break under too much weight or impact, causing Sarah or objects to fall through.
Interaction: Placing heavy objects on these surfaces can open up new routes, or use lighter materials like balloons to lighten the weight and keep an existing path intact.
Metallic Surfaces:
Behavior: Surfaces that interact with magnetic objects, creating unique puzzle dynamics.
Interaction: Use magnetized plates to pull objects across these surfaces or create moving platforms.

Interactive Environmental Elements:
These environmental elements interact with physics objects and play a crucial role in puzzle-solving:
Pressure Plates:
Behavior: Stepping or placing objects on these plates triggers doors, lifts, or other environmental interactions.
Interaction: Players can place objects on pressure plates to open doors, activate lifts, or move platforms, allowing Sarah to progress through the level.
Trigger Doors:
Behavior: Doors that open or close based on pressure plate activation or other triggers in the environment.
Interaction: Players must find and activate the correct trigger, such as placing an object on a pressure plate, to open these doors.
Lifts:
Behavior: Platforms that move vertically to transport Sarah or objects to different heights.
Interaction: Activate lifts by placing objects on pressure plates or solving specific puzzles to access higher or lower parts of the level.
Moving Platforms:
Behavior: Platforms that travel horizontally or vertically, allowing Sarah to cross large gaps or reach different areas.
Interaction: These platforms can be triggered by pressure plates, magnets, or other mechanisms in the environment. The player must time movements carefully to ensure Sarah's safe passage.
Levers and Buttons:
Behavior: Levers that the player can activate to open doors, move platforms, or change the state of the environment.
Interaction: Levers can be pulled directly by Sarah or manipulated indirectly using objects such as sticky rope. Players must figure out how and when to activate these levers to progress.
Teleporter Pad
Behavior: A capsule shaped structure that will serve as finish line to end the level
Interaction: Will make Sarah disappear in a flashing animation after Sarah walks inside it.

Player Progression:
Level Design:
The levels will be linear in structure, but each puzzle will encourage player freedom, creativity, and resourcefulness. There will be multiple ways to solve each puzzle, allowing players to use the physics objects in different combinations to reach the Teleporter Pad at the end of each level.
The player can approach the solution in various ways, promoting experimentation and flexible problem-solving.
Level-Based Progression:
Players progress by completing levels, with puzzles increasing in complexity as new mechanics and hazards are introduced.
Levels unlock sequentially, with new physics objects and hazards being introduced as players advance.
Levels are divided into thematic "zones" with unique environmental features and challenges, such as water hazards, wind zones, or magnetic puzzles.
Level Selection
After every level the game will take the character to a level select screen that will allow the player to to select the next unlocked level or previously played levels
Score and Ranking System:
At the end of each level, players receive a 3-star rating based on the number of cheese fragments they collect.
3 Stars: Collected all cheese fragments.
2 Stars: Collected most of the cheese fragments.
1 Star: Collected some cheese fragments or completed the level without fragments.
Stretch Goal: Earning higher star ratings unlocks challenge modes with additional gameplay objectives when you replay levels, such as completing levels under time limits or using fewer objects.

Side Objectives and Collectibles:
Cheese Fragments:
In addition to reaching the cheese at the end of each level, players can collect hidden cheese fragments. These fragments are often placed in challenging or hard-to-reach areas, requiring creative problem-solving to acquire.
Rewards: Cheese fragments affect the player's score and help unlock challenge modes, such as time trials or object-use restrictions, for additional gameplay.
Stretch Goal: Challenge Mode:
Some levels when unlocked will include optional challenge mode objectives that will test a player’s skill when they are asked to complete the level under certain conditions.
Example objectives include:
"Complete the level using no more than 3 physics objects."
"Solve the puzzle without letting Sarah touch water."
"Complete the level without using a specific object."
Rewards: Completing challenge mode objectives can unlock a trophy or even unique cosmetic skins for Sarah

Art Style:
The game will have a 3D cartoonish art style with anthropomorphized characters. Characters including Sarah and other potential NPCs, will have exaggerated, lively features that add charm and personality to the world. The environments will match this style, with lab equipment and obstacles designed in a whimsical yet recognizable way.
User Interface (UI):

The player will have a button to switch between controlling Sarah (the lab mouse) and a zoomed out camera that allows you to see the rest of the level.
A simple pause menu button will be included for in-game options.
The HUD should remain clean and non-intrusive, ensuring the player has a clear view of the game world at all times.
Audio & Sound Design:
The audio design will contribute to a playful atmosphere, with light-hearted and whimsical sound effects. For example when physics objects are placed or moved, there can be satisfying fun sound cues like pops, squeaks, or bounces.
Background music will be upbeat and light, creating a sense of joy and curiosity as players solve the puzzles.
When players successfully solve a puzzle, there will be a sound effect that emphasizes a sense of achievement, reinforcing the feeling of cleverness and resourcefulness.
Player Experience Goals:
The core player experience goal is to make players feel clever and resourceful. Overcoming each puzzle should leave the player with a sense of accomplishment, as if they outsmarted the environment by using creative solutions.
The game will encourage experimentation without heavy penalties for failure, creating a positive feedback loop where players are motivated to try new ideas.

Art Direction
The art of Mindshift brings its quirky, puzzle-filled world to life with a vibrant, cartoonish style that is both whimsical and accessible. Designed with mobile platforms in mind, the visual aesthetic strikes a balance between simplicity and charm, ensuring that players can easily identify interactive objects while immersing themselves in the imaginative world of Cerebella's adventure.
Style and Inspiration
3D World, 2D Perspective: The game features 3D models presented from a 2D static side-camera, giving players a clear view of the puzzle environments. This makes it easier to interact with physics objects while keeping the overall gameplay intuitive.
Cartoonish and Exaggerated: The characters and environments are designed with exaggerated proportions and bright colors, adding a playful and approachable feel to the game. Cerebella, the lab mouse, has expressive animations that react to player actions, helping to bring her personality to life.
Clean, Minimalist UI: The game’s interface is intentionally kept simple to leave more screen space for gameplay. Buttons and controls are designed to be sleek, with minimal clutter, ensuring players can focus on solving puzzles.
Environmental Design
Each environment in Mindshift is designed to reflect the lab's different areas, with unique visual elements and themes that match the gameplay mechanics of each zone:
Sterile Research Lab: Clean, clinical surfaces with lots of metallic and glass elements. The use of sterile whites and soft blues contrasts with the lively character of Cerebella, making her stand out in the environment.
Hydroponics Lab: Lush greens and earthy tones create an overgrown yet scientific feel. Interactive objects like wooden planks and floating leaves reflect the natural but controlled environment.
Radioactive Quarantine Zone: Darker tones with glowing green highlights create a more dangerous atmosphere. The textures of corroded metal and cracked tiles visually signal the increased difficulty and hazards that Sarah will face in these levels.
Character Design
Cerebella (Sarah):
Cerebella blends the physical traits of a real-world mouse with the posture and movements of a human. She can alternate between standing upright and on all fours. She has the sleek Brain Band on her head glowing faintly as she uses her telekinetic abilities. Her lab coat is slightly oversized and frayed at the edges, adding to her scrappy charm. Her lively animations and exaggerated movements give her reactions a humorous and endearing quality.

Dr. Thalamus:
Dr. Thalamus is a wiry figure clad in a crisp lab coat, with thick goggles that completely obscure his eyes adding an unsettling air of mystery. His oversized mustache protrudes humorously through two small holes cut into his surgical mask. His movements are sharp and precise, but there’s an unpredictable edge to his mannerisms that hints at the fervent mind beneath the mask.

Blue:
Blue is a glowing, mouse-shaped AI companion with a vibrant neon-blue hue and an anime-inspired design. Its sleek, angular form features expressive, oversized eyes that shift color to reflect emotion. Blue’s movements are distinctly anime-inspired, with dynamic, exaggerated gestures full of energy—leaping dramatically, spinning in mid-air, and striking playful poses that bring a sense of excitement and charm. Its vibrant glow and lively personality make it an unforgettable presence alongside Cerebella.
Animation
Smooth and Expressive: Character animations are kept smooth and expressive to emphasize the light-hearted and playful tone of the game. When Cerebella interacts with objects or hazards, her exaggerated animations (such as flailing or bouncing) add a humorous element, making even mistakes feel enjoyable.
Responsive Physics Interactions: Visual feedback when interacting with objects is critical. When players drag objects or Sarah moves through the environment, small visual cues—like bouncy pads compressing or balloons swaying—help reinforce the game’s physics-driven mechanics.

Technical Considerations
To accommodate a small team, the art pipeline will focus on creating reusable assets and prioritizing a clean, simple style over hyper-detail. By relying on pre-built shaders, simple textures, and minimalistic lighting, we can keep performance smooth on mobile devices while still delivering a visually engaging game.
Modular Design: Levels will be built using modular pieces, such as repeatable lab tiles, to save on art production time while maintaining a polished look.
Mobile Optimization: We’ll use optimized 3D models with low-polygon counts to ensure the game runs smoothly on various mobile devices without sacrificing visual quality.
