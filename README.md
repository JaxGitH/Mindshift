# Mindshift
So we will be operating off the same update rules as the prototype. We will merge into the DEV branch and keep the MAIN branch for tested stable builds of the game. <br /> 
When we get to the scrum sprints everyon that is working on the same sprint will work in the same branch. After a branch is merged delete the branch you were working on. <br />
I have added a Depricated folder "zzDepricated" so that it appears at the bottom. If something is old or just no longer useful let us put these items in there instead of deleting them. <br />
The wiki is now up. Please use it to stay up to date. The GDD can be edited by anyone. So if you ask a quetion about details that have not been added or you notice something is not up to date please just update it yourself and mark the date.
